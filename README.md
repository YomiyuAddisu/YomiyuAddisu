Project title: A Rule-Based Samrt City Simulation 
This title is given for group 8 section 10 students.Our project simulates the operations of a *smart city* using rule-based logic in Python. It is a beginner-level simulation aimed at understanding how a city could function intelligently by following predefined rules.

We focus on modeling different components of a city such as:

* 🚦 Traffic lights and vehicle flow
* 🌳 Waste collection
* ⚡️ Energy usage
* 🚒 Emergency response
* 🏥 Hospital availability
* 🚰 Water supply management

Each of these components follows simple if-then rules. For example:

* *If traffic is high at an intersection, then extend green light duration.*
* *If garbage level > 80%, then dispatch a collection vehicle.*
* *If hospital beds < 20%, then redirect patients to the next nearest hospital.*

By coding these rules in Python, we simulate how the city adapts to changing conditions using logic-based decisions.

### 🖼 Visual Representation Ideas:

You can include simple flowcharts and diagrams to explain the logic behind each module:

#### Example 1: Traffic Light Logic

[Traffic Level] --> [High?] --> [Yes] --> [Green Light = 60s]
                                   |
                                   --> [No] --> [Green Light = 30s]

#### Example 2: Waste Management

[Garbage Bin Sensor] --> [Level > 80%?] --> [Yes] --> [Dispatch Truck]
                                            |
                                            --> [No] --> [Do Nothing]

You can create these diagrams using tools like [draw.io](https://draw.io), [Canva](https://canva.com), or even Python libraries like matplotlib or graphviz.

### 🧠 How We Make It Smart:

The "smart" part of the city comes from the rules it follows. These rules are written in Python as functions or if-statements that respond to real-time city data (simulated randomly or input manually).

# Example rule-based logic in Python
def manage_traffic(traffic_density):
    if traffic_density > 70:
        return "Extend green light to 60s"
    else:
        return "Use normal green light timing"

---

### 🎮 Interactive Demo Idea:

You can make a basic terminal-based interface where users can:

* Enter current city data (traffic, garbage level, etc.)
* See how the system reacts based on rules
* Display simulation results using text or simple bar charts

Example output:

Traffic density: 85%
>> Action: Extend green light

Garbage level: 90%
>> Action: Send collection vehicle

### 💡 Why This Project Is Important:

* Encourages smart decision-making through simple rules
* Introduces concepts of artificial intelligence in a practical way
* Shows how Python can be used to model real-world systems
* Prepares us for building more complex AI or data-driven city models in the future.

1. A city map with icons representing traffic, hospital, energy grid, etc.
2. Flowcharts showing rule logic for each component
3. A screenshot of your Python program running the simulation
4. A timeline or dashboard of simulation results.

Here’s a clear and beginner-friendly instruction guide on how to set up and run our Rule-Based Smart City Simulation Project using Python. This can be included in our report or GitHub README file.


## 🛠 Setup and Run Instructions

### 📦 Requirements:

To run this project, you need:

* Python 3.x installed on your computer
* A code editor (like VS Code, PyCharm, or even IDLE)
* Basic libraries (already built into Python or easy to install)

---

### ✅ Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 1️⃣ Install Python (if not already installed)

* Go to [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Download and install Python 3.x
* Check installation:

    python --version
  

---

#### 2️⃣ Clone or Download the Project

If using GitHub:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-city-simulation.git
cd smart-city-simulation

Or manually download the .zip file and extract it.

---

#### 3️⃣ (Optional) Create a Virtual Environment

This step helps keep your project clean.

python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate      # Linux/macOS
env\Scripts\activate         # Windows

---

#### 4️⃣ Install Required Libraries (if any)

If you're using extra libraries like matplotlib, colorama, or prettytable, install them:

pip install matplotlib colorama prettytable

If you're using only basic Python features, you can skip this step.

---

#### 5️⃣ Run the Project

Inside the project folder, run the main Python file:

python main.py

Or double-click the .py file if you're using an editor like IDLE.

---

### 🎮 Using the Simulation

* When you run the simulation, it may ask you to enter inputs such as:

  * Traffic level
  * Garbage bin status
  * Energy usage
  * Hospital capacity
* Based on your input, the system will apply if-then rules and show:

  * Actions to be taken
  * Suggestions for smart resource management
* Some versions may simulate data randomly to show automatic decision-making.

---

### 🖥 Example Output:

Welcome to Smart City Simulation
--------------------------------
Enter current traffic level (0-100): 80
>> Traffic is high. Extending green light to 60 seconds.

Enter garbage level (0-100): 90
>> Bin is full. Dispatching waste collection truck.

Enter hospital bed usage (0-100): 95
>> Alert: Critical hospital capacity. Redirecting to nearby facility.

### 💬 Tips

* Modify the rules in the code to test new behaviors.
* You can extend the system by adding more components (like smart parking or water distribution).
* Try to visualize outputs using bar charts or flow diagrams using libraries like matplotlib.


Here’s a list of the main features of our Rule-Based Smart City Simulation Project:
